                        <p>Simply put, I am a web developer. I design, create, and support full-fledged websites. Everything you see here, I coded. Most of what you <i>don't</i> see here, I also coded. What you see is the front end: the layout, design and visuals.  What you don't see is the back end: server support, web hosting and certain rules to keep things running smoothly.  Why is this important? Because I am able to manage full-scale projects, making the possibilities endless! I have a true passion for web development, it is not simply a job for me. I am committed to providing quality service that speaks to my skill, talent and vision.</p>
